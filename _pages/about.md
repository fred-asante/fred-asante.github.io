 I am currently a fifth year Ph.D. candidate in accounting at Johnson College of Business, Cornell University. I received an MBA from Wake Forest University and a BBA in Accounting  (with high distinction) from Howard University.  
 
My research interests lie in the intersection of accounting, banking, contracting, corporate social responsibility and development economics, with a specific focus on how debt markets, financial and supply chain regulation shape economic behavior in developed and developing economies. In financial regulation, my research broadly explores how the harmonization of regulation affects decision-making of local financial institutions.

Prior to joining the Johnson Ph.D. program in 2021, I held various roles at Bank of America within corporate finance and commercial banking. I have previous experience at Deloitte & Touche, J.P. Morgan and Lockheed Martin
