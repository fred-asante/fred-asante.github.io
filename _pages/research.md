**Working Papers**

* **"Global Rules, Local Realities: The effect of adopting expected credit loss model in informal economies"** 
  * Job Market Paper
  * Won 2025 Dyckman Research Grant Awards
  * Abstract:  This study examines the effects of international harmonization of accounting standards, specifically regulator-imposed adoption of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model, on credit market dynamics in informal economies. Motivated by global initiatives to improve financial reporting transparency, the shift to the ECL framework altered lenders' risk assessment practices. Employing staggered difference-in-difference and shift share design around the ECL implementation, I document a contraction of loan supply in poor informal communities, coinciding with rising local interest rates—not to offset higher actual losses, which decline, but due to increased collateral and compliance costs necessitated by the new standards. Loan-level evidence reveals a notable disappearance of unsecured lending in rural markets. These shifts correspond with reduced economic activity—measured by nighttime luminosity—in poorer, underserved communities. My findings highlight how regulatory harmonization and changes in accounting standards can unintentionally exacerbate financial exclusion in economies where information frictions are most severe.



* **"The LIBOR-SOFR Transition and the Use of Financial Covenants"** with John Donovan (Notre Dame) and Arthur Morris (HKUST)
  * Abstract:  Most credit agreements specify interest rates relative to a base rate, which allows interest payments to adjust to market conditions without the need to renegotiate the contract. The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was the standard base rate, until a combination of changes in the credit market and high-profile scandals led central banks around the world to develop alternatives and between 2021 and 2023 U.S. credit markets transitioned to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The LIBOR-SOFR transition directly impacted lenders’ ability to price credit risk. We explore how debt contract terms are used to manage this transition. We find that loans that transition from LIBOR to SOFR use more financial covenants, and that this increase is driven by performance, rather than capital, covenants. Next, we compare changes in the terms of loans that transition from LIBOR to SOFR to those that are issued with a SOFR base rate. In this setting we find a similar association between financial covenant use and SOFR adoption. We believe that this analysis presents two unique insights. First, this is evidence on how markets use non-price mechanisms to manage uncertainty inherent to the transition. Second, this expands the focus of the literature from it’s focus on spreads to include the entire debt contract.

* **"The Effect of Private Pressure on Corporate Disclosures: Evidence from a Field Experiment"** with Mary Adenale (UT Austin), Tendai Masaya (Penn State), David Park (Seoul National)
  *  Under Review at TAR
  *  Abstract: Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires SEC filers to disclose their use of conflict minerals in their products to ensure supply chain transparency on minerals that could contribute to financing armed groups. Motivated by the continuous decline in conflict minerals disclosures (CMD) filings, we examine the effect of private pressure on the disclosures. Specifically, we investigate whether and how exerting private pressure on firms through their grievance mechanisms, in the form of an anonymous person informing a firm that one of its suppliers is, in fact, sanctioned, affects its subsequent CMD choices. Using a randomized field experiment, we find that informing firms of the potential sanction violation causes them to remove the sanctioned entity from, or explain why it remains in, their CMD. Providing a disclosure example explaining why a firm may have a sanctioned entity in its CMD increases the focal firm’s likelihood of explaining rather than removing the entity from its disclosures. We also analyze firms' engagement levels with our inquiries and find that many firms actively investigated the concerns we highlighted via their grievance mechanisms. Overall, we find some evidence that private pressure through grievance mechanisms affects corporate disclosure choices.


**Working in Progress**
* **"Sustainability Tariffs"** with Samuel Chang (Chicago Booth), Hans Christensen (Chicago Booth), Donald N’Gatta (MDE-Ivory Coast)
  * Abstract: We examine how bilateral trade flows and commodity prices respond to corporate sustainability initiatives prompting importer due diligence. As the demand for sustainable cocoa increases in Europe and North America, cocoa trade flows to these markets shift away from producing countries with less established traceability mechanisms. Despite this, these generally less-developed economies have maintained their overall export volumes by redirecting trade to importing countries with weaker sustainability preferences, but this shift is associated with a 5 percent decrease in average sales price. Despite shifts in trade flows and export prices, deforestation rates in cocoa-producing countries have not declined regardless of their export volumes to the US and Europe. We also find a similar trade redistribution in the coffee market. Our findings suggest that—due to differential traceability costs in producing countries—supply chain sustainability can have similar consequences to a commodity tariff on less-developed economies without alleviating environmental harm.


* **"Sustainability Tariffs"** 
  *  Data collection stage 
  * Abstract: This paper examines how improvements in property rights systems—through the rollout of collateral registries and land title registration—reshape credit markets in developing economies. Using the introduction of a national collateral registry, I study whether banks increase their reliance on collateralized lending once ownership of pledged assets can be formally verified. I further investigate whether the effect of registries depends on local institutions: in areas where chiefs retain greater control over land allocation, and whether alignment of traditional and formal systems improves access to credit.
